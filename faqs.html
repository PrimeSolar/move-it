              <p>
                To prepare for your move, we recommend starting by decluttering
                and getting rid of items you no longer need. Pack an essentials
                box with items you'll need on moving day. Schedule your move
                with us in advance to ensure availability. Any furniture that
                needs to be disassembled will be taken care of by our team. All
                boxes will be clearly labeled.
