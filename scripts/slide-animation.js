/*
 * Slide Animation Script
 *
 * This script manages slide animations for specific elements on the webpage
 * and includes a custom logging module to monitor currently active animations.
 *
 * 1. **Style Use**: on DOMContentLoaded, a <style> element is created and appended to the document head,
 * defining CSS styles for slide animations.
 *  - **.slide-animation**: sets initial styles for opacity and vertical translation.
 *  - **.slide-animation.visible**: defines the final state of visibility and original position.
 *
 * 2. **Element Selection and Animation Class Application**:
 *  - Selects all <img> (excluding those with classes "d-block", "w-100", "rounded-5"), <h2>, and <p> elements.
 *  - Applies the "slide-animation" class to these elements to prepare them for animation.
 *
 * 3. **Intersection Observer**:
 *  - Sets up an "IntersectionObserver" to track the visibility of animated elements.
 *  - When an observed element comes into view, the "visible" class is added, triggering the slide animation.
 *
 * 4. **Custom Logger Module**: a code is created to watch for animations of elements.
