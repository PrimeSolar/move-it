/*
 * Image Zoom Script
 *
 * This script enhances the user experience by applying zoom and shadow effects to images
 * on a webpage when hovered over, unless specifically disabled.
 *
 * 1. **Event Listener on DOMContentLoaded**: the script runs once the entire DOM has finished loading.
 *
 * 2. **Image Selection**: it selects all images on a page to apply the hover effects.
 *
 * 3. **Scaling Effect**: images without the class "no-zoom" will scale up when hovered over.
 * A transition duration is set for smooth scaling and shadow effects.
 *
 * 4. **Shadow and Brightness Effect**: for images with the class "zoom-with-shadow",
 * a shadow is added and brightness is slightly reduced on hover.
 * These styles are reset when the mouse leaves the image.
